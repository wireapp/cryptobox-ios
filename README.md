#Â Cryptobox for iOS

This project provides cross-compiled binaries of [cryptobox](https://github.com/wireapp/cryptobox) for iOS, currently only in the form of static libraries.

## Building

A rust cross-compiler is needed that supports the following iOS architectures:

  * armv7-apple-ios
  * armv7s-apple-ios
  * i386-apple-ios
  * aarch64-apple-ios
  * x86_64-apple-ios

For instructions on how to build such a cross-compiler, refer to the [Rust Wiki](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-wiki-backup/blob/master/Doc-building-for-ios.md).

To perform the build:

    make dist

**Note**: Link against the following native artifacts when linking against the `libcryptobox.a` static library. The order and any duplication can be significant on some platforms, and so may need to be preserved:

  * library: sodium (`libsodium.a` is distributed as part of this project)
  * library: c
  * library: m
  * library: System
  * library: objc
  * framework: Foundation
  * framework: Security
  * library: pthread
  * library: c
  * library: m
